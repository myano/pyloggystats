This project creates a web page from logs obtained by loggy.py 
( http://inamidst.com/code/loggy.py ). It is also backwards compatible 
with the logs taken by eggdrop v1.6.19. 

I do not have any plans to have it be compatible with other logging formats
as I encourage people to use Sean B. Palmer's loggy.py script.

This was inspired by the pisg project.

----------

TO RUN:

Open up stats.py and change the variables in the beginning labelled
LOGS_LOCATION, FILE_EXTENSION, CHANNEL, and USER.

In the future this script will support command line arguments instead.

----------

The recipe.py was obtained from a blog of which I have lost the link for.
There wasn't a license attached with it and I'm releasing it under
my project which is license by the GNU GPL v3.
